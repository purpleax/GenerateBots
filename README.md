This utility generates Bot activity to my origin server sitting behind a CDN.

You need your CDN to rewrite the SourceIP to the Source IP specified in the X-Source-IP header.


The Bot Categories are defined in the categories.ini file, with the ability to put weights on them so that the traffic across each category is uneven (and looks a bit more realistic)
